# Scheduler - A Schedule Generator in Excel. Must have Office 2021+. Older Excel versions may work but may break features or not work at all. Office Web Excel will not support pictures updating so use the Desktop version.

If you have found this, this is a simple schedule generator i created in my spare time.

Thought i may put it here and see if anyone else finds it useful and maybe contribute make it better. Who knows, maybe it'll make someones life way less stressfull.

Instructions are now inside the excel file.

I worked on this on my own time in order to learn more of excels functions. Feel free to modify this sheet to fit your situation.
I will try to make it more user friendly in my spare time if i can.

This scheduler for me is now low priority. But if you want features added, then let me know and ill see what i can do. No promises.
Next project will be creating a standalone program if time allows and i need a project.

NOTE:
  Most of the dashboard features and some other functions rely on office 2021 features, and will display an error in older versions of Excel.
