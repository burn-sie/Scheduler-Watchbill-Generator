# Scheduler - A Navy Watchbill Generator in Excel. Must have Office 2019+. Excel 2016 may work but may break some stuff. Office Web Excel will not support the pictures updating so use the Desktop version. May create multiple version of watchbill later.

If you have found this, this is a simple navy monthly watchbill generator i created in my spare time.

Thought i may put it here and see if anyone else finds it useful and maybe contribute make it better. Who knows, maybe it'll make someones life way less stressfull.

Instructions are now inside the excel file.

I worked on this on my own time in order to learn more of excels functions. Feel free to modify this sheet to fit your situation.
I will try to make it more user friendly in my spare time if i can.


Notes: The box next to the roster will turn Green, Yellow, or Red, depending if the person is in a group / duty section.
       The numbers on the "Panel" sheet will update when you change something, if your feeling adventurous, Unhide the "MiscFormulas" tab and customize if you like.


This scheduler for me is now low priority. But if you want features added, then let me know and ill see what i can do. No promises.
Next project will be creating a standalone program if time allows and i need a project.


hmmm reworking on this so realease will come in the future.
