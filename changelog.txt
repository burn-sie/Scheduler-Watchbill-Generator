Changelog:
V.09 - Rearranged Layout.
            Added refrence so changes can be made directly from the panel tab. Makes it easier to use.
           Started adding comments to options. Makes it easier to understand.
           Started editing charts to account for different amounts of active groups.
           Changed order and made "stop if true" for Conditional Formatting" in some sheets, this reduces lag    
           when scrolling.
           Added Freeze Pane to roster so the graphs do not move while filling out table. Makes it easier to fill
           while having all the information that may be needed visible.
           Removed extra line from Upcoming Holidays.
V.08 - Added error correcting to roster. If you dont add a last name, comma, and a first name, it will try to 
           "guess" only the last name. Keeps the watchbill uncluttered. If you still mess up it'll default to using 
           the whole cell for the name.
            Added warning to the date box in roster. When filling cell, it'll warn you when input entered is not
            a date, and give you examples on how you can enter a date.
            Switched some formating to be controlled by conditional formatting.
            Rewrote how we check if someone is scheduled on a vacation day. The warning window should now
            display the days that conflict with vacation.
            Added Option to only show non schduled people in the group drop downs to make it easier to fill.
            Reworked Formulas in WatchbillMONTHLY to be more efficient and possibly easier to modify in the 
            future. 
            Removed unneded conditional formating where any value of 0 would be set to white. Not needed
            with new formulas.
            Fixed a typo in conditional formatting for a green highlight in the personnell roster. Now if the date a 
            person has left already passed, it should still stay highlighted green. Changed one > to a <.
            Cleaned up redundant conditional formatting to speed up worksheets.
            Updated formula in personnell to extract the first letter of the first name, This makes its easier to tell 
            people apart if the share a last name.
            Rearranged Panel sheet to make it more printer friendly.
            Changed Formulas for upcoming holidays box and deleted the updating picture in the panels sheet.

            Added more slots for groups.
            Changed LAMBDA functions to nested XLOOKUPS with INDIRECTS so the vacation tracker can work on

           Vacation Roster no longer a drop down and just copies the entire roster onto its sheet.
           Added hidden helper column to TimeOffTracker sheet to help find people scheduled on vacation.
           Converted table in TimeOffTracker sheet to range for mitigation spills a table cannot handle.
           Counter for personnel in groups now goes by counting people in the groups and not a work around.
           Counter for personnel in groups will highlight, to give you a warning, if your roster vs people assigned dont add up.
v.05 - Added Vacation Tab to keep track of time off.
           Added Warning picture to the panel tab. It'll warn of potential conflicts in scheduling and other factors.
